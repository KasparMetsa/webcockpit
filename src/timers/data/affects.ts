// Affects MUME puts on a character (Inv §2.6.5): the game lines that start,
// refresh and drop each one, its nominal duration and its type. Facts about
// the game, written in our own format (ADR 0017 "Game data").
//
// A line is the full text of one game line (matched exactly, after colour
// is stripped) or `{ prefix }` for the few lines that end in a variable part.
// One line may serve several affects: `Your energy wanes as your second wind
// fades.` drops *second wind* and starts *winded*; the comfortable lines
// move between *comfortable* and *very comfortable*. The trackers apply the
// drops of a line before its starts.
//
// `start` and `refresh` behave the same in the tracker (a start on an active
// affect refreshes it, a refresh on an inactive one starts it); they are kept
// apart because that is what the game means by them.
